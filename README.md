This repository contains a comprehensive face recognition attendance system implemented using machine learning techniques in Python.
The system captures real-time video streams or images, identifies faces, and matches them against a database to mark attendance. It includes functionalities for dataset management, model training, and integration with attendance management systems. This project aims to provide an efficient, automated solution for attendance tracking using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies.
